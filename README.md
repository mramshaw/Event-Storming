# Event Storming

[Event Storming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Storming) is
is a way to abstract the key events in a system, and is often used with
[Domain-driven design (DDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

In this example we have the events of the somewhat less than
happy case where a car owner has decided to fight a traffic
ticket and needs to take a personal day to attend traffic court.

Their tool (which I beta-tested to a small degree, and was
used to produce the above diagram) does a nice job of compressing
white space as necessary while respecting places where it is needed
for readability.
