# SEDA (Staged Event-Driven Architecture)

There's an old axiom that a chain is only as strong as its' weakest link.

Likewise a series of sequential processes can only proceed at the speed of the slowest process.

SEDA is a strategy for ___decoupling___ processes to allow for bursty or irregular traffic patterns.
